Outliers in `age` were handled using the IQR method, removing data points outside 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 and above Q3.\n","\n","\n","### 2. Data Analysis Key Findings\n","\n","* **No Missing Values:** The dataset contained no missing values.\n","* **Potential Outliers:** Potential outliers were observed in the `absences` (maximum 32) and `age` (maximum 22) columns, addressed through capping and IQR methods respectively.\n","* **Feature Interaction Impact:**  Adding interaction features (`studytime_failures_interaction`, `freetime_goout_interaction`, `Dalc_Walc_interaction`) did not improve the linear regression model's performance; in fact, it slightly decreased the R-squared score on the validation set (0.866 with interactions vs 0.873 without).\n","* **RandomForestRegressor Performance:** The RandomForestRegressor achieved an R-squared of 0.852 on the validation set before hyperparameter tuning.  After hyperparameter optimization and training on the combined training and validation sets, the final model achieved an R-squared of 0.7456 on the held-out test set.\n","* **Optimized Hyperparameters:** The best hyperparameters for the RandomForestRegressor, found using RandomizedSearchCV, were `{'n_estimators': 599, 'min_samples_split': 5, 'min_samples_leaf': 4, 'max_features': None, 'max_depth': 10}`.\n","\n","\n","### 3. Insights or Next Steps\n","\n","* **Investigate Feature Engineering:** The engineered features did not improve the model. Further exploration of other potential feature interactions or transformations might yield better results.\n","* **Explore Alternative Models:** Try different regression models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression) to see if they perform better than the optimized RandomForestRegressor.  Consider more advanced feature selection methods.\n"],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8cHyfEEAEZbK"}}]}
